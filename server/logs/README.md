# Logging System

This directory contains log files generated by the AI Analyst application. The logging system is designed to provide comprehensive visibility into the multi-agent workflow and API operations.

## Log File Structure

Log files are organized by component and follow the naming convention:
- `api.log` - Main API request/response logging
- `agent_<agent_name>_<instance_id>.log` - Agent-specific logs
- `analysis_worker_<analysis_id>.log` - Background analysis task logs

## Log Format

Each log entry follows this format:
```
TIMESTAMP - AGENT_ID - LEVEL - LOGGER_NAME - MESSAGE
```

Additional metadata is included in the JSON-formatted `extra` field.

## Log Levels

- `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging
- `INFO`: General operational information
- `WARNING`: Indicates potential issues
- `ERROR`: Errors that don't prevent the application from running
- `CRITICAL`: Severe errors that may cause the application to stop

## Log Rotation

Log files are rotated when they reach 10MB, with up to 5 backup files kept.

## Viewing Logs

To view logs in real-time, use:
```bash
tail -f logs/api.log
```

Or for a specific agent:
```bash
tail -f logs/agent_<agent_name>_<instance_id>.log
```

## Logging Best Practices

1. Use appropriate log levels
2. Include relevant context in log messages
3. Use structured logging with the `extra` parameter for machine-readable data
4. Be mindful of logging sensitive information
5. Rotate logs regularly to manage disk space
